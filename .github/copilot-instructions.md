This repository holds a sample application that demonstrates how to integrate a chatbot in a sample dotnet application using AI agents.
For the agent, we use semantic kernel, which is a framework for building AI applications with LLMs. 
The sample application is built using .NET 9 and uses the Azure OpenAI service to provide the AI capabilities.
For the web side of the application, we use Blazor Server, which allows us to create interactive web applications using C# instead of JavaScript.
The infrastructure is provisioned using Azure Developer CLI (azd) and is deployed to Azure Container Apps.
Use powershell to run the commands in this repository.
